# PalindromeChecker
The Palindrome Checker is a simple JavaScript web application that allows users to input text and check if it is a palindrome. It works by evaluating the input string for symmetry, disregarding spaces, punctuation, and case. This project helps demonstrate fundamental skills in web development, including JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and DOM manipulation.
