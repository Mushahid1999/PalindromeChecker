# PalindromeChecker
## Overview
The Palindrome Checker is a simple JavaScript web application that allows users to input text and check if it is a palindrome. It works by evaluating the input string for symmetry, disregarding spaces, punctuation, and case. This project helps demonstrate fundamental skills in web development, including JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and DOM manipulation.
## Features
* Palindrome Check: Users can input text to verify whether itâ€™s a palindrome.
* Case-Insensitive: The checker ignores case to correctly identify palindromes.
* Whitespace and Punctuation Ignorance: Spaces, commas, and other punctuation do not affect the check.
* Real-Time Feedback: The result is displayed instantly, showing whether the input is a palindrome or not.
## Technologies Used
* HTML: For the structure and layout of the page.
* CSS: For styling and making the application responsive.
* JavaScript: For the logic that checks the palindrome and handles user interaction.
* DOM Manipulation: To dynamically interact with HTML elements.
## How to Use
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/palindrome-checker.git
2. Open the index.html file in your browser.
3. Enter a string in the input field and click the "Check" button to see if the input is a palindrome.
4. The result will appear below the input field, indicating whether the string is a palindrome.
## Example 
Here is an example input and output:
* Input: race car
* Output: race car is a palindrome
